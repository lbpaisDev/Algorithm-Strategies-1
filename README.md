# Algorithmic Strategies

This repo includes a brute force and a backtracking solution for the following problem.

You are the head member of a Pirate Radio named Radio GaGa. Your clandestine emissions are attracting more and more listeners, but your distribution infrastructure is small and provides limited geographical coverage, thus denying listeners from farther distances the opportunity to listen the fantastic contents that Radio GaGa broadcasts on a daily basis.
There is only one option: expand the infrastructure! To do so, you have identified the locations of new listeners that manifested interest in the radio and candidate locations to install new antennas to extend the coverage of Radio GaGa. However, Radio GaGa has a low budget and the investments in new antennas must be done with caution... There are different antenas with different coverage radius and costs, and the choice of which type of antenna is to be installed in which locations is critical.
Your job is to decide which antennas to place at which locations in order to provide full coverage to all the new listeners spending the least money you can.
